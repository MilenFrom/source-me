# Source Me

<p align="left"><em>Source Me</em> is a small application which provides the necessary tools while developing a web application. The need for this application was because i was too lazy to go to the web & search for the packages, or fonts, or material design colors. So a small app was to be built to provide the necessary resources in a single click ! <br>The application is built on <a href="https://electron.atom.io/">Electron.</a></p>
